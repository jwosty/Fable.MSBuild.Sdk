        I'm sure all of these forceful overrides have a butterfly effect, but hey, this is a POC, so just do whatever it
        takes to make it not blow up for now. Real fixes are welcome.

        FIXME: (error NETSDK1005): This blows up with
            error NETSDK1005: Assets file obj/project.assets.json doesn't have a target for 'fable4.0'
        so just skip it for now. I'm suspicious this has something to do with NuGet not having our custom TFM in its
        hardcoded logic, causing it to behave differently than for net7.0 for example. I've tried playing with
        the NuGetTargetMoniker property, but it seems to already get set correctly. I've also tried manually editing
        project.assets.json and replacing all instances of 'Fable,Version=4.0' with 'fable4.0' or even 'fable40':
        no cigar.
        
        I like my package assets unresolved anyway...
